# Iterator-Pattern

The Iterator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection (like a list or array) sequentially without exposing the underlying structure of the collection. Here's a simple explanation in layman's terms:

What is the Iterator Pattern?
Imagine you have a bookshelf filled with books. You want to look at each book one by one. Instead of trying to reach into the bookshelf and figuring out how to grab each book, you use a simple tool: a book indexer. This book indexer helps you go through each book on the shelf, one at a time, without needing to know how the books are arranged or stored.

Key Points:
1. Sequential Access: It allows you to go through a collection of items one by one in a specific order.
2. No Exposure: You don't need to understand or access the internal structure of the collection.
3. Consistency: The way you access elements is consistent, regardless of the collection's type.


Real-World Analogy:
Think of a remote control for a TV. The remote has buttons to move to the next channel or the previous channel. You don't need to know how the TV is processing these commands internally; you just use the remote to navigate through the channels sequentially.
